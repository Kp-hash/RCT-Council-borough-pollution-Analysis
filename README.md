World Car Free Day 2020 Car Free Day is an annual global movement that encourages people to avoid using their cars for one day on 22nd September. All around the world towns and cities allow people to experience stress free of motor traffic. It is a great chance to re-imagine our streets around people. https://www.livingstreets.org.uk/about-us/our-work-in-action/world-car-free-day. This is a statistical analysis around the benefits and the impact of introducing this day. During this analysis, we explored the following points:
<br/>
• The current pollution issue, both across the world, the UK and in a localised area.<br/>
• Why a car free day will be ideal for your area and the impact on pollution. <br/>
• What benefits of a car free day would there be? including health and climate change statistics.<br/>
• Would a one car free day have an impact on pollution?<br/>
We used different statistical tools from the SAS software for the implementation and based the conclusions on inferences from the data.<br/>
